// Java Close Resources
//When working with files, streams, or other resources, it is important to close them after use. If you forget to close a resource, it may keep using memory or even prevent you from opening the file again until the program ends.
//
//Note: You have not yet learned about files and streams in detail. These topics will come in the next chapters. For now, just focus on how try-with-resources works.
//
//In older code, you had to close "resources" manually by calling their close() method:


// Java try-with-resources
//Since Java 7, you can use try-with-resources. It is a special form of try that works with resources (like files and streams). The resource is declared inside parentheses try(...), and Java will close it automatically when the block finishes - even if an error occurs.

//EXAMPLES

import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
public class TryWithResources {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("filename.txt");
            output.write("Hello".getBytes());
            output.close();  // must close manually
            System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing file.");
        }

        //Example (try-with-resources)
        // resource is opened inside try()
        try (FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("filename.txt")) {
            output.write("Hello".getBytes());
            // no need to call close() here
            System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing file.");
        }
    }
}

// Why use try-with-resources?
//Safer - resources are always closed, even if an exception occurs.
//Cleaner - no need to write close() calls.
//Shorter code - less boilerplate, easier to read.
//Rule of thumb: Whenever you work with files, streams, or database connections, use try-with-resources to make sure they are closed properly.
