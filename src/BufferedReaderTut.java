// BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
// BufferedReader and BufferedWriter make reading and writing text files faster.
// BufferedReader lets you read text line by line with readLine().
// BufferedWriter lets you write text efficiently and add new lines with newLine().
// These classes are usually combined with FileReader and FileWriter, which handle opening or creating the file. The buffered classes then make reading/writing faster by using a memory buffer.

// Read a Text File (Line by Line)
// Use BufferedReader with FileReader to read each line of a file:

// Example


import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
public class BufferedReaderTut {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("filename.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file.");
        } // output : Some text from filename.txt

    }
}

// Comparing File Reading Classes
// Java gives you several ways to read files. Here's when to pick each one:

// Scanner - best for simple text. It can split text into lines, words, or numbers (e.g., nextInt(), nextLine()).
// BufferedReader - best for large text files. It is faster, uses less memory, and can read full lines with readLine().
// FileInputStream - best for binary files (like images, PDFs, or audio)
