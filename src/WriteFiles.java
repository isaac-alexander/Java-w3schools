// Write To a File
//If you are just starting with Java, the easiest way to write text to a file is by using the FileWriter class.
//
//In the example below, we use FileWriter together with its write() method to create and write some text into a file.
//
//Note: When you are done, you should close the writer with the close() method:
//

// Write To a File with try-with-resources
//Since Java 7, you can use try-with-resources. This makes sure the writer is closed automatically, even if an error occurs:


// Append to a File
//Normally, FileWriter will overwrite a file if it already exists. If you want to add new content at the end of the file (without deleting what's already there), you can use the two-argument constructor and pass true as the second parameter. This puts the writer into append mode:

//Example

import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class WriteFiles {
    public class WriteToFile {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt");
                myWriter.write("Files in Java might be tricky, but it is fun enough!");
                myWriter.close();
                System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            // output Successfully wrote to the file.

            // Write To a File with try-with-resources
            // FileWriter will be closed automatically here
            try (FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt")) {
                myWriter.write("Files in Java might be tricky, but it is fun enough!");
                System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            // OUTPUT: Successfully wrote to the file.

            // Append to a File
            // true = append mode
            try (FileWriter myWriter = new FileWriter("filename.txt", true)) {
                myWriter.write("\nAppended text!");
                System.out.println("Successfully appended to the file.");
            } catch (IOException e) {
                System.out.println("An error occurred.");
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            // OUTPUT: Successfully wrote to the file.
        }
    }
}

// Explanation: This program adds the text "Appended text!" to the end of filename.txt instead of replacing the file's content.
//
//Note: If the file does not already exist, Java will create it before appending.
//
//Tip: To see what's inside the file, go to the Java Read Files chapter.
//
//Other Ways to Write to Files
//There are several classes you can use to write files in Java:
//
//FileWriter - easiest choice for basic text.
//BufferedWriter - better for large text files, because it is faster and supports handy features.
//FileOutputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs)
