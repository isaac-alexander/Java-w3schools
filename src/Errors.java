// Java Errors
//Even experienced Java developers make mistakes. The key is learning how to spot and fix them!
//
//These pages cover common errors and helpful debugging tips to help you understand what's going wrong and how to fix it.
// Types of Errors in Java
//Error Type	        Description
//Compile-Time Error	Detected by the compiler. Prevents code from running.
//Runtime Error	Occurs while the program is running. Often causes crashes.
//Logical Error	Code runs but gives incorrect results. Hardest to find.

// Common Compile-Time Errors
//Compile-time errors occur when the program cannot compile due to syntax or type issues.
//
//Here are some examples:
//
//1) Missing Semicolon

// Example
// int x = 5
// System.out.println(x);
//Result: error: ';' expected

// Tip: Java requires a semicolon at the end of every statement (int x = 5;).

// 2) Undeclared Variables

//Example
//System.out.println(myVar);
//Result: cannot find symbol  symbol: variable myVar

// Tip: You must declare a variable before using it (int myVar = 50;).

// 3) Mismatched Types

//Example
//int x = "Hello";
//Result:
//incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int

// Tip: Make sure the value matches the variable type (String x = "Hello";).

// Common Runtime Errors
//Runtime errors occur when the program compiles but crashes or behaves unexpectedly.
//
//Here are some examples:
//
//1) Division by Zero

// Example
//int x = 10;
//int y = 0;
//int result = x / y;
//System.out.println(result);
//Result:

//Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

// 2) Array Index Out of Bounds
//
//Example
//int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
//System.out.println(numbers[8]);
//Result: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 8 out of bounds for length 3

// Logical Errors
//Logical errors happen when the code runs, but the result is not what you thought:
//
//Example:
//int x = 10;
//int y = 2;
//int sum = x - y;
//System.out.println("x + y = " + sum);
//Result: x + y = 8
// Expected Result: 12

//Logical Error: The code mistakenly subtracts instead of adds.

// Good Habits to Avoid Errors
//Use meaningful variable names
//Read the error message carefully. What line does it mention?
//Check for missing semicolons or braces
//Look for typos in variable or method names
