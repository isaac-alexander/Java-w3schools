//Java Operators

// Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
// In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

// Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:


public class Operators {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 100 + 50;
        System.out.println(x);

        int sum1 = 100 + 50;
        int sum2 = sum1 + 250;
        int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;
        System.out.println(sum1);
        System.out.println(sum2);
        System.out.println(sum3);

    }
}

// Java divides the operators into the following groups:

// Arithmetic operators
// Assignment operators
// Comparison operators
// Logical operators
// Bitwise operators
