// The Collections Framework
// The Java Collections Framework provides a set of interfaces (like List, Set, and Map) and a set of classes (ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.) that implement those interfaces.
//
//All of these are part of the java.util package.
//
//They are used to store, search, sort, and organize data more easily - all using standardized methods and patterns.

// Tip: Think of the Collections Framework as a toolbox.
//
//Interfaces like List define what tools can do, and classes like ArrayList are the actual tools that do the work.
//
//Core Interfaces in the Collections Framework
//Here are some common interfaces, along with their classes:

//  Interface	Common Classes          Description
//  List        ArrayList, LinkedList   Ordered collection that allows duplicates
//  Set         HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet Collection of unique elements
//  Map         HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap	Stores key-value pairs with unique keys

// Overview of Classes
//The table below gives an overview of the common data structure classes and their characteristics:

//  Interface	Class	Description
//  List	ArrayList	Resizable array that maintains order and allows duplicates
//  LinkedList	List with fast insert and remove operations
//  Set	HashSet	Unordered collection of unique elements
//  TreeSet	Sorted set of unique elements (natural order)
//  LinkedHashSet	Maintains the order in which elements were inserted
//  Map	HashMap	Stores key/value pairs with no specific order
//  TreeMap	Sorted map based on the natural order of keys
//  LinkedHashMap	Maintains the order in which keys were inserted


// Use List classes when you care about order, you may have duplicates, and want to access elements by index.
//
//Use Set classes when you need to store unique values only.
//
//Use Map classes when you need to store pairs of keys and values, like a name and its phone number.
