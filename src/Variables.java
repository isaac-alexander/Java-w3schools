// Java Variables
//Variables are containers for storing data values.

//In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
//String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
//int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
//float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
//char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
//boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

// Declaring (Creating) Variables

//To create a variable in Java, you need to:
//Choose a type (like int or String)
//Give the variable a name (like x, age, or name)
//Optionally assign it a value using =
//Here's the basic syntax:

// type variableName = value;
// For example, if you want to store some text, you can use a String:
//
//Example
//Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John".
//Then we use println() to print the name variable:


public class Variables {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String name = "John";
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
