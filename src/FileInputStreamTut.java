// FileInputStream
//So far, you have used the Scanner class to read text files. Scanner is very convenient for text because it can split input into lines, words, or numbers. However, sometimes you need more control. For example, when reading binary data (like images, audio, or PDFs), or when you need full control of raw bytes. In those cases, you use FileInputStream.
//
//Read a Text File (Basic Example)
//This example uses FileInputStream to read a text file, one byte at a time, and print the result as characters:


//Example
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileInputStreamTut {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // "try-with-resources": the stream will be closed automatically
        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("filename.txt")) {
            int i;
            while ((i = input.read()) != -1) {
                System.out.print((char) i);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error reading file.");
        }

        // Copy a Binary File (Real-World Example)
        // The real strength of FileInputStream is that it can handle any file type, not just text. Here is an example that copies an image file:
        // Copy image.jpg into copy.jpg
        try (FileInputStream input = new FileInputStream("image.jpg");
             FileOutputStream output = new FileOutputStream("copy.jpg")) {

            int i;
            while ((i = input.read()) != -1) {
                output.write(i);  // write the raw byte to the new file
            }

            System.out.println("File copied successfully.");

        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error handling file.");
        }

    }

}

// Explanation: This program reads image.jpg and writes it into copy.jpg. Since it works with raw bytes, it can copy any kind of file - text, images, audio, or PDFs.
//
//Note: The program also uses FileOutputStream. While FileInputStream is used to read bytes from a file, FileOutputStream is used to write bytes to a file. Together, they make it possible to copy any kind of file.
//
//You will learn more about FileOutputStream in the next chapter.
//
//Choosing the Right Class
//Java gives you several ways to read files. Here's when to pick each one:
//
//Scanner - best for simple text and when you want to parse numbers or words easily.
//BufferedReader - best for large text files, because it is faster and reads line by line.
//FileInputStream - best for binary data (images, audio, PDFs) or when you need full control of raw bytes.
