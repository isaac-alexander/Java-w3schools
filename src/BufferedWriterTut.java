// BufferedWriter
// The BufferedWriter class is used to write text to a file, one line or one string at a time. If the file already exists, its contents will be replaced (overwritten).
// Write to a Text File
// Use BufferedWriter with FileWriter to write text to a file. The write() method adds text, and you can use newLine() to insert a line break:

// Append to a Text File
//To add new content to the end of a file (instead of overwriting), pass true to FileWriter:

// Example

import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
public class BufferedWriterTut {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("filename.txt"))) {
            bw.write("First line");
            bw.newLine();  // add line break
            bw.write("Second line");
            System.out.println("Successfully wrote to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing file.");
        } // output : Successfully wrote to the file.
        // Explanation: This program creates (or overwrites) filename.txt and writes two lines of text into it. The newLine() method inserts a line break between "First line" and "Second line". If everything goes well, the console will print "Successfully wrote to the file."

        // Append to a Text File
        // true = append mode
        try (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("filename.txt", true))) {
            bw.newLine();                      // move to a new line
            bw.write("Appended line");         // add new text at the end
            System.out.println("Successfully appended to the file.");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Error writing file.");
        } // output : Successfully appended to the file.
        // Explanation: This program keeps the existing content of filename.txt and adds a new line with the text "Appended line" at the end. If everything works, the console prints "Successfully appended to the file."
    }
}
// Comparing File Writing Classes
// Java gives you several ways to write to files. Here's when to pick each one:

// FileWriter - best for simple text writing. Quick and easy to use.
// BufferedWriter - better for larger text files, because it is faster and lets you easily add line breaks with newLine().
// FileOutputStream - best for binary files (like images, PDFs, or audio)
