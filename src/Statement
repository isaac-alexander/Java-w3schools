Statements
A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Java is fun!" to the screen:

ExampleGet your own Java Server
System.out.println("Java is fun!");
It is important that you end the statement with a semicolon ;.

If you forget the semicolon (;), an error will occur and the program will not run:

Example
System.out.println("Java is fun!")
Result:

error: ';' expected

Many Statements
Most Java programs contain many statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
    System.out.println("Have a good day!");
    System.out.println("Learning Java is fun!");
  }
}
