// Print Text
//You can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:
// You can add as many printIn() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method
//
//Double Quotes
//Text must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".
//If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:


//----------------------------------------------
//The Print() Method
//There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
//
//The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output
// Note that we add an extra space (after "Hello World!" in the example below) for better readability.

// ------------------------------------
//Print Numbers
//You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
//
//However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quote
// You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method:

public class Print {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
        System.out.print("Hello World! ");
        System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
        System.out.println(3);
        System.out.println(358);
        System.out.println(50000);
        System.out.println(3 + 3);
        System.out.println(2 * 5);

    }
}
