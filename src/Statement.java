// The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written:
//
// From the example above, we have three statements:
//
// System.out.println("Hello World!");
// System.out.println("Have a good day!");
// System.out.println("Learning Java is fun!");
// The first statement is executed first (print "Hello World!" to the screen).
// Then the second statement is executed (print "Have a good day!" to the screen).
// And at last, the third statement is executed (print "Learning Java is fun!" to the screen)
