// Abstract Classes and Methods
//Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
//Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).
//
//The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:
//
//Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).
//
//Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).
//An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:


abstract class Abstraction {
    // Abstract class
        // Abstract method (does not have a body)
        public abstract void animalSound();
        // Regular method
        public void sleep() {
            System.out.println("Zzz");
        }

    // Subclass (inherit from Abstraction)
    static class Pig extends Abstraction {
        public void animalSound() {
            // The body of animalSound() is provided here
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
    }



}

class Aain {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Abstraction.Pig myPig = new Abstraction.Pig(); // Create a Pig object
        myPig.animalSound();
        myPig.sleep();
    }
}

// Why And When To Use Abstract Classes and Methods?
//To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.
//
//Note: Abstraction can also be achieved with Interfaces, which you will learn more about in the next chapter.
