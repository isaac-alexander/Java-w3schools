// What is Debugging?
//Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in your code.
//
//It often involves:
//
//Reading error messages
//Tracing variable values step by step
//Testing small pieces of code independently
//Tip: Debugging is a skill that improves with practice. The more you debug, the better you get at spotting problems quickly.

// Print Statements for Debugging
//The most basic (and often most effective) way to debug Java code is to use System.out.println() to print values and check the flow of the program.
//
//In this example, the first line "Before division" will print, but the second line is never reached because the program crashes due to division by zero:
//
//Example
// int x = 10;
//int y = 0;
//
//System.out.println("Before division");  // Debug output
//
//int result = x / y;  // Crashes
//
//System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Never runs
//Result:
//
//Before division
//Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
// Tip: Add print statements before and after key lines of code to find out where things go wrong.

// Check Variable Values
// If something unexpected happens, print out the values of your variables:

// Tip: This is a good way to test whether a condition is working correctly - try changing age to 18 or 19 and observe the output!

public class Debugging {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 17;
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);

        if (age >= 18) {
            System.out.println("Access granted");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Access denied");
        }
    }
}

// Debugging with IDEs
//Modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans come with built-in debugging tools.
//
//Set breakpoints to pause the program at specific lines
//Step through code line by line
//Inspect variable values in real time
//Tip: Use your IDE's debugger to find errors faster - it's more powerful than print statements alone!
//
//Debugging Checklist
//Read the full error message, it often tells you exactly what's wrong
//Check if all variables are initialized before use
//Print variable values to trace the problem
//Watch for off-by-one errors in loops and arrays
//Comment out sections of code to find bugs
