// Interfaces
//Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.
//
//An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies: EXAMPLE
// // interface
//interface Animal {
//  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
//  public void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)
//}

// To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class:

interface Pnimal {
    public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
    public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Multiple Interfaces
// To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:
interface FirstInterface {
    public void myMethod(); // interface method
}

interface SecondInterface {
    public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method
}
public class Interface implements Pnimal,  FirstInterface, SecondInterface{

        public void animalSound() {
            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
        }
        public void sleep() {
            System.out.println("Zzz");
        }

    // DemoClass "implements" FirstInterface and SecondInterface
        public void myMethod() {
            System.out.println("Some text..");
        }
        public void myOtherMethod() {
            System.out.println("Some other text...");
        }

}

class New {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Interface myPig = new Interface();
        myPig.animalSound();
        myPig.sleep();
        myPig.myMethod();
        myPig.myOtherMethod();
    }
}

// Notes on Interfaces:
//Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "Animal" object in the MyMainClass)
//Interface methods do not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
//On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
//Interface methods are by default abstract and public
//Interface attributes are by default public, static and final
//An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
//Why And When To Use Interfaces?
//1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).
//
//2) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because the class can implement multiple interfaces.
